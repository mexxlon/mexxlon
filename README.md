# Good day everbody, im Mexxlon! Lets get raedy to fail ;)<br>

## This is my first version of the .md README! <br> 

### Today, we are starting the WD Bootcamp on neueFische and I am in a group with Ana and Hauke to create the first README! The path to web development is rocky and challenging. Let's walk it together! My goal is to have an app or website "in hand" at the end. I am highly motivated and ready!<br> 3..2..1...code!<br>

About me:<br>

:book: * I am eager to learn JavaScript, HTML, and CSS at a professional level. * <br>
:white_check_mark: * I like food, basketball, soccer, hardware, and software. * <br>
:warning: * I don't like cats (please don't start a shitstorm). ;) * <br>
