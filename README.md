# Good day everybody! I'm mexxlon, let´s git raedy to fail!

### Today, we are starting the WD bootcamp on neueFische and this is my first version of the README.md! The path to web development is rocky and challenging. Let´s walk it together! My goal is to have an app or website "in hand" at the end. I am highly motivated and ready to be a part of web dev!<br>

About me:<br>

:book: * I am eager to learn JavaScript, HTML, and CSS at a professional level. * <br>
:white_check_mark: * I like rap, techno, jazz, basketball, soccer, tinkering hardware/software. * <br>
:warning: * I don't like cats (please don't start a shitstorm). ;) * <br>
